Summary: I try to commit to writing in tiddlywiki once a day for 30 days

====== Tiddlywiki entry everyday for 30 days ======

I'm going to make it a goal to make a tiddlywiki entry every day for 30 days. This will be in effort to help form a habit. Here is my plan, add items to track quick ideas like Million dollar ideas, things to research, plans for the house, programming/learning notes. Really Tiddlywiki should be quick and dirty, I want this dokuwiki to be more mature, organized, especially since it's versioned with git. With that I can more or less commit myself to goals (even though the goals section is just as "set in stone" as this is).
I need to tiddly for 30 days, wiki 30 days, blog 30 days, keepass 30 days. Physically, I should stationary bike for 30 days, lift weights/push ups 30 days, run 30 days.
Here are some blog entry ideas:
  * thoughts on RPM macros, Fedora installing them now with an RPM
  * thoughts on new KDE/plasma and the work laptop
  * reflect on 30 day progresses
  * golang efforts
I can't think of any more right now, but I should put them in Tiddlywiki. By the way, Ubuntu keeps the trackpad enabled whereas Fedora has it insensitive. I've already highlighted and deleted this text... This needs to change.

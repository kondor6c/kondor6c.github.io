Summary: Brief look at performance with perf and a couple terminals

====== urxvt vs Eterm ======
So I was trying different terminals so that I can keep on terminal just for a screencast sessions. I want to keep screencasting clean and partitioned. Additionally I have admitted to myself (now everyone else) that I need to know more about profiling the system, I got [http://www.brendangregg.com/books.html](Breddan Gregg's book ) on system performance, so far its very through. One complaint is that as a Solaris guy and even regarding many of his Linux presentations and writings is that he really favors dtrace, for obvious reasons; its a fantastic tracing tool. However due to license restrictions it isn't available on Linux (except for [ http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-dev/dtrace-on-linux-1956556.html](OEL )). So I have first been reading up and trying out tools like perf. All the while I kept reading that urxvt has a lower footprint than many other terminals; in order to get some of these metrics they were using metrics [ https://www.void.gr/kargig/blog/2008/06/22/the-quest-for-a-better-rxvt-unicode-on-gentoo/](like ) [ https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-539368-view-previous.html?sid=d495c38e4482f4e9e59e1f969fc45f2e](RSS ) and [ https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=125217](htop ) output.... While other use [ https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=65634](install size) and [ http://www.calno.com/evilvte/](striped binary size ).... tisk tisk. Where has the massive use of htop come from? I understand it has colors, but it doesn't bring much more to the table (and you have to install it)!
Well I remembered using Eterm, and that it had [ http://arstechnica.com/features/2000/03/simd/](SMID optimizations ), I thought that I would give perf a try to figure this out. This output is far from through, and is extremely basic (I would like to do some more analyzing)

I ran ps auxf as quick as I could, far from scientific. But the results are interesting. I did add a few color settings to .Xdefaults (solarized and tab support).

In short, try to think about other tools at our disposal, we are fortunate to not have a few tools that a vendor distributes, instead many great people have encountered problems and have written tools that we can use. I try to avoid top output unless I'm in super quick triage kind of situation, where I need to understand what is going on in a disaster. Additionally plan ahead because I don't believe that perf is installed by default on many distributions.

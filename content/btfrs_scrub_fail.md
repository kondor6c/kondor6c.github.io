btrfs scrub fail
================

I wrote this earlier on a internal corporate blog (Atlassian's Confluence), but I don't think many read it, it doesn't give out any corporate information, but since I wrote it on "company time" I figured I should put it there. But with the late night phone calls and the subsequent difficult time in falling asleep I think a few minutes here and there all balances out. That's another topic for another time. Here is a repost of the blog. I'm really only putting it here for the sake of context and centralizing my posts. This was written on May 11th 2016.

I have been trying/using btrfs. I have really wanted to give it a chance even and I thought a perfect place for that would be at home. So a little bit of background my home machine is a Xeon E5-2620 v3 and it's got 32GB of ECC RAM, I have 4x3TB disks that are in a btrfs RAID 5 setup, it mostly holds torrents (all legal of course), virtual machine disks, and backups (old army documents, pictures). Things had been going rough when I first tried using btrfs (on my root volume), but that turned out to be a bad SSD, nothing to do with the RAID 5. So I kept ext4 on my SSD (rootfs) and I continue to use btrfs on the RAID. Just last week I had a disk fail due to bad sectors, I had time to replace it but after the replace operation.
```bash
[root@horse ~]# btrfs replace start /dev/sdf /dev/sde /mnt/extra
```
I continue to get unrepairable errors.... btrfsck doesn't address it, btrfs scrub on finds the errors. The volume mounts, and unmounts, it just seems that I should be able to address these without going into a recovery, I think it happened during the course of the replace operation. I was able to move the files to a different volume, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I found the files by looking at the inode that the checksum failed with. As I continue to address these errors I'll keep you posted on the status of my btrfs experience. I was hesitating using ZFS due to the licensing issues. I have long been a fan of ZFS, I think I might try it now; after all I have ECC RAM which is the recommendation. Another thought is to just delete the disk, then re-add it, since it seems to be just one that has the errors.

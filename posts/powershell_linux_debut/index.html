<p>I began to experiment with Powershell. I feel that Microsoft has to follow through on showing the community that it meant what it said, that Microsoft Loves Linux. Perhaps I can lump myself into that group too, because I remember the October Document, and the utter frustration in trying to get Linux to work in a mostly Windows environment. I think Microsoft senses that the game is changing, and is changing with it. Linus Torvalds had said that &ldquo;If Microsoft ever does applications for Linux it means I&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo; and now that they are changing their business practices to bring software to Linux, is totally incredible. Its good as a company they are becoming a software company that makes software for products in demand.</p>
<p>While I am writing this I am trying to use Powershell to some degree, my family members and friends/co-workers have told me to look into Powershell (I think mostly to assist with scripts ;-) but still). My initial observations is that everything is well laid out, with thought, Get-<em>, Invoke-</em>, Set-* (you get the idea). However as a shell, something you interact with frequently just to get a look at things it makes features such as tab completion very hard since they&rsquo;re all the same structure. I see both sides, it being good for a consistent theme, but it gets extreme. Really what it feels like is more of an object oriented language shell. Yeah, kinda awkward. I would like to revisit this awkward-ness and either support it with more evidence or</p>

I could see this causing problems, especially since type is a builtin of BASH. I don&rsquo;t know off the top of my head why Get-Content would be effectively symlinked.</p>

<p>Granted this is an alpha version, I found it hard to get &ldquo;help&rdquo; on this item using &ndash;help, -help, /help did not&hellip; help! Later learned that there is a facility entirely to this Get-Help (aka man!). Also consider that powershell will act as coreutils + more, as in it won&rsquo;t have bc, wget/curl, vi, tar, or others. So powershell needs to include many these functions with itself; Invoke-RestMethod, this will come in handy later! We can set alias&rsquo; but I thought some of the alias&rsquo; I would be overwriting Linux utilities and then I would be in a world of pain (Yes I could specify the full path, but still not fun).</p>
<p>In conclusion this is a good thing, I don&rsquo;t want my negativity to make it sound like anything bad. But I could never imagine using this as any kind of a default shell any time soon or ever. I haven&rsquo;t actually got to learn that much about it, I&rsquo;ve done more typing than learning.</p>

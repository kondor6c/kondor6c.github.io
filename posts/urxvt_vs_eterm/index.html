			<p>====== urxvt vs Eterm ======
So I was trying different terminals so that I can keep on terminal just for a screencast sessions. I want to keep screencasting clean and partitioned. Additionally I have admitted to myself (now everyone else) that I need to know more about profiling the system, I got [http://www.brendangregg.com/books.html](Breddan Gregg&rsquo;s book ) on system performance, so far its very through. One complaint is that as a Solaris guy and even regarding many of his Linux presentations and writings is that he really favors dtrace, for obvious reasons; its a fantastic tracing tool. However due to license restrictions it isn&rsquo;t available on Linux (except for <a href="OEL"> http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-dev/dtrace-on-linux-1956556.html</a>). So I have first been reading up and trying out tools like perf. All the while I kept reading that urxvt has a lower footprint than many other terminals; in order to get some of these metrics they were using metrics <a href="like"> https://www.void.gr/kargig/blog/2008/06/22/the-quest-for-a-better-rxvt-unicode-on-gentoo/</a> <a href="RSS"> https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-539368-view-previous.html?sid=d495c38e4482f4e9e59e1f969fc45f2e</a> and <a href="htop"> https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=125217</a> output&hellip;. While other use [ https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=65634](install size) and [ http://www.calno.com/evilvte/](striped binary size )&hellip;. tisk tisk. Where has the massive use of htop come from? I understand it has colors, but it doesn&rsquo;t bring much more to the table (and you have to install it)!
Well I remembered using Eterm, and that it had [ http://arstechnica.com/features/2000/03/simd/](SMID optimizations ), I thought that I would give perf a try to figure this out. This output is far from through, and is extremely basic (I would like to do some more analyzing)</p>

<p>In short, try to think about other tools at our disposal, we are fortunate to not have a few tools that a vendor distributes, instead many great people have encountered problems and have written tools that we can use. I try to avoid top output unless I&rsquo;m in super quick triage kind of situation, where I need to understand what is going on in a disaster. Additionally plan ahead because I don&rsquo;t believe that perf is installed by default on many distributions.</p>

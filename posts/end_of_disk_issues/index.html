			<p>I have a workstation that I have built, it contains a multi-disk Large Form Factor ZFS array. There have been multiple posts in the past about some of my disk related problems that I&rsquo;ve handled, you should be able to find them with a &lsquo;zfs&rsquo; or &lsquo;disk&rsquo; tag. Well I had several issues, that I hope should be calming down; going back to January, where I decided to move from 4x3TB RAID-Z (software RAID 5) to 4x4TB 7200RPM RAID 10 setup. The transition was prompted by this event and I really have written this up to share my experience with others. I spoke casually about this with Jim Salter, Michael Hrivnak, Wes Widner, and several others, but I brought it up mostly because of Jim&rsquo;s project <a href="https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/sanoid">Sanoid</a> and he&rsquo;s presented on ZFS before. I had one disk start clicking when I got back from running, I could see in <code>dmesg</code> that this disk was not responding and was trying to be reset; important thing to point out, ZFS had brought the disk OFFLINE. I had a spare 4TB &lsquo;eco&rsquo; drive that really doesn&rsquo;t deliver the performance that is needed and would hinder the array, but I wanted to get the disk replaced so that I could get another one ordered. Well I hooked the disk up, and started the zfs replace process. I woke up and found that another disk, in this RAID-Z, had reported as failing (FAULTED), all during the replace process. I knew this was very bad, two disks failing, and you can&rsquo;t stop a resilver, but you can stop a scrub, by using <code>zpool scrub -s ${pool}</code>, what I should have done is brought the disk &ldquo;online&rdquo; but what I did, could have been worse&hellip; I rebooted my workstation! During the resilver/replace process, not my finest hour.
This array doesn&rsquo;t hold too much, but it does hold &ldquo;warm&rdquo; backups (staged to go on to different disk stored elsewhere), KVM disk images (virtual machines), and other various data, usually high write IO that I don&rsquo;t want to wear on my SSD/NVMe drive, I could stand to lose this array, but I don&rsquo;t want to because it would be painful. When the machine came back, the pool was imported and the resilver restarted, this time with the clicking disk &ldquo;ONLINE&rdquo; however the other faulted disk, was now &ldquo;UNAVAILABLE&rdquo;, so I have a replace going of an online disk that is in a poor state, but ZFS had recovered from this, and the replace completed successfully. I then transferred the data elsewhere, rebuilt the pool as a RAID-10.
The pool is now with all 7200 RPM disks in a RAID-10 setup. ZFS looks at this as one mirror (RAID 1) with a striped disk set (RAID 0), this might be confusing, I will perhaps try to do a video to cover this more. Here is some output of my now healthy disk status:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The issue that I think I had encountered for a while, was that I plugged three 4TB 7200RPM disks using the same SATA power plug coming from the power supply. I had thought I was up against a bad controller/port/cable and I plugged a red SATA cable in to signify that &ldquo;red is dead&rdquo;, but the issue continued when I plugged it into another SATA port. I realized that when I put the hard drive in a top unit or in a USB3 SATA drive, that the disk was fine it didn&rsquo;t even spin cycle. I believe that this new disk array was consuming more power enough that the disk would power on, but upon doing load wouldn&rsquo;t service the ATA commands quick enough, and linux would then reset it. Similar to this</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Giving this &ldquo;bad disk&rdquo; a dedicated power plug resolved these issues. I had a similar issue when adding five 1U HP DL160&rsquo;s to a Cabinet, Friday night I hooked them all up, and we started the HDFS rebalance, but upon getting load on those machines, we got a phone call from Sungard saying that we&rsquo;re exceeding the power limit. Load can influence things, in many ways, I knew this; I guess this one just took me longer to realize.</p>
<p>In other news, I have created a video on my camera showing the process of using a Yubikey and <code>pass</code> to get versioned passwords, but I realized that it was very ad-hoc and I deleted the video. I spent a fair amount of time editing in KDEnlive and audacity, but I just was not pleased with the end product so I will be redoing it and uploading it shortly. I also plan on writing up my home router creation and performance testing of MySQL as I hinted at last blog post. I did some performance testing of docker storage drivers and needless to say we will be avoiding btrfs, I didn&rsquo;t test with <code>nodatacow</code> as a mount option, but really XFS and overlay2 didn&rsquo;t have that option and performed very well. This test wasn&rsquo;t exhaustive, but enough to give an idea and fulfill proper investigation/baselining to change the storage drivers that my employer is using, without getting into too many details, a contractor configured us to use one that should not be used in production.</p>

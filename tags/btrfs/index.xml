      <description>RAID5 btrfs total failure and subsequent abandonment My btrfs volume failed last night. I tried to rebalance the array to a &amp;quot;JBOD&amp;quot; (just a bunch of disks), it seems that it failed during that rebalance. To really drill down into the failure, it seems based on lines of the device info (bdev...) both those devices have errors. I suspect that these one batch of these read errors were directly due to the failure last time, (this one has rd 76 corrupt 16, other one had corrupt 8 and read 76).</description>

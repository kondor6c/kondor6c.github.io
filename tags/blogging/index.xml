      <description>I really enjoyed SouthEast LinuxFest this year, probably more this year than I did last year. Mostly because I made a point of being more outgoing and interacting with more people. Last year I attended I had tried talking to a few people but didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a good feel for things, and volunteered for the FSF booth and tried to take the Ham radio exam. This year I attended many presentations, had an opportunity to go to a Birds Of a Feather meeting on containers put on by Michael at RedHat.</description>

      <description>After a few issues that almost perfectly lined up to steal momentum I&amp;rsquo;m going to resume blogging. If you follow this (I doubt many were/are), I apologize for the lack of updates. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to briefly run down some of the events that lead to the large (almost year delay):
The Prior Events  Before SouthEast Linux Fest my Wife&amp;rsquo;s mother very unexpectedly died. After SELF I had some motivation and tried to look into interesting topics, generally Software Defined Radio (I liked the LimeSDR) and followed some crypto currency investigation which lead to Zcash.</description>

      <description>New video I&#39;ve wanted to make videos for a while now, and I finally have. I rehearsed for a couple iterations now, I wrote the outline and all the commands out before hand; [[public:linux:common#openssl|here is where you can view the outline/commands]] . Everything went pretty smoothly, everybody I spoke to in my circle spoke positively about it, I wish I could get a couple more reactions about the technical content. I tried to upload the video to a public locations: vimeo &amp;lt;https://vimeo.</description>

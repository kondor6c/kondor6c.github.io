      <description>After a few issues that almost perfectly lined up to steal momentum I&amp;rsquo;m going to resume blogging. If you follow this (I doubt many were/are), I apologize for the lack of updates. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to briefly run down some of the events that lead to the large (almost year delay): The Prior Events  Before SouthEast Linux Fest my Wife&amp;rsquo;s mother very unexpectedly died. After SELF I had some motivation and tried to look into interesting topics, generally Software Defined Radio (I liked the LimeSDR) and followed some crypto currency investigation which lead to Zcash.</description>

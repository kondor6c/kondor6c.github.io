      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m very excited that GNUTLS has support for ed25519 keys, these keys are faster, smaller, and more secure than RSA keys. I found this out from a developer&amp;rsquo;s blog while doing research and messing around with CA&amp;rsquo;s in December. The reason I&amp;rsquo;m writing this is that GNUTLS 3.6 has been made available in Fedora 28, therefore can all use this. Additionally and perhaps more importantly we gain the the ability to use TLS 1.</description>

      <description>New video I&#39;ve wanted to make videos for a while now, and I finally have. I rehearsed for a couple iterations now, I wrote the outline and all the commands out before hand; [[public:linux:common#openssl|here is where you can view the outline/commands]] . Everything went pretty smoothly, everybody I spoke to in my circle spoke positively about it, I wish I could get a couple more reactions about the technical content. I tried to upload the video to a public locations: vimeo &amp;lt;https://vimeo.</description>

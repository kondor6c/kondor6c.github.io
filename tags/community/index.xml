      <description>I really enjoyed SouthEast LinuxFest this year, probably more this year than I did last year. Mostly because I made a point of being more outgoing and interacting with more people. Last year I attended I had tried talking to a few people but didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a good feel for things, and volunteered for the FSF booth and tried to take the Ham radio exam. This year I attended many presentations, had an opportunity to go to a Birds Of a Feather meeting on containers put on by Michael at RedHat.</description>

      <description>x2go or freenx I have had the worst time with x2go both on Fedora and Ubuntu, I thought neatx from Google was the preferred method for doing remote sessions but I heard that had changed. x2go doesn&#39;t even offer a Windows client like NoMachine offers. I was trying to test libpng on a scaleway Fedora 22 ARM server (https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-6c07ab1fa6). I guess I&#39;ll have to find another way of doing that.</description>

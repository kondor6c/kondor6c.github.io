      <description>I really enjoyed SouthEast LinuxFest this year, probably more this year than I did last year. Mostly because I made a point of being more outgoing and interacting with more people. Last year I attended I had tried talking to a few people but didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a good feel for things, and volunteered for the FSF booth and tried to take the Ham radio exam. This year I attended many presentations, had an opportunity to go to a Birds Of a Feather meeting on containers put on by Michael at RedHat.</description>

      <description>After a few issues that almost perfectly lined up to steal momentum I&amp;rsquo;m going to resume blogging. If you follow this (I doubt many were/are), I apologize for the lack of updates. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to briefly run down some of the events that lead to the large (almost year delay): The Prior Events  Before SouthEast Linux Fest my Wife&amp;rsquo;s mother very unexpectedly died. After SELF I had some motivation and tried to look into interesting topics, generally Software Defined Radio (I liked the LimeSDR) and followed some crypto currency investigation which lead to Zcash.</description>
